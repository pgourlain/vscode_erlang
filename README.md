## Build

- Standard rebar3 is the default build tool, also rebar is supported. The rebar.config file should be placed in the root directory.
- Build arguments are configurable, by default "compile" is used
- You can override the default in configuration file (i.e. workspace settings)

## Running debugger  
You can provide a specific command line to 'erl' in launch.json configuration file in "arguments" entry.

The modified code may be automatically build before debugger is started. To set automatic build up you need to:
  1. Add to launch.json file the entry "preLaunchTask": "rebar3 compile"
  1. Select **Configure Task** in the alert, choose **Create tasks.json file from template** and then **Others: Example to run an arbitrary command**
  1. This will create tasks.json for you. Change both label and command to "rebar3 compile".
  1. Add entry "problemMatcher": "$erlang"

Then, before debugging is started, modified files will be recompiled automatically.
