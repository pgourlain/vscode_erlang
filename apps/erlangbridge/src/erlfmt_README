The files vscode_erlfmt... have been copied from https://github.com/WhatsApp/erlfmt
in order to keep the extension self contained. The files have been update with new
module names (vscode_erlfmt instead of elrfmt) and functions to provide escript and
rebar plugin functionality have been removed. The license of the original files
is in erlfmt_LICENSE.
